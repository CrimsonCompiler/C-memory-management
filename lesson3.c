/*
Interpreted Quiz

Up until now, you've probably only worked with interpreted languages on Boot.dev. 
Use the following interpreted (in this case, Python) code to answer the question.

```
print("starting")
func_that_doesnt_exist("uh oh")
print("finished")

```

Assume func_that_doesnt_exist is a function that truly does not exist.

--- What will happen when the code runs? --- 
a ) A stack trace due to an undefined function call
b ) 'starting' prints then a stack trace due to the undefined function call then 'finished' prints
c ) 'starting' prints then 'finished' prints

Answer: b
