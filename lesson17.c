Ternary

Like JavaScript, C has a ternary operator:

int a = 5;
int b = 10;
int max = a > b ? a : b;
printf("max: %d\n", max);
// max: 10

Let's break down the syntax:

a > b ? a : b

    a > b is the condition
    ? begins the "then" value
    a is the final value if the condition is true
    : separates the "else" value
    b is the final value if the condition is false
    The entire expression (a > b ? a : b) evaluates to either a or b, which is then assigned to max in our example.

Ternaries are a way to write a simple if/else statement in one line.
